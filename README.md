# PhoneBook

Welcome to the PhoneBook repository! This project is a simple phonebook
application that allows you to manage your contacts, add new ones, and delete
existing ones.

## Technologies Used

PhotoMap is built using a modern stack of technologies:

- **React:** The fundamental library for creating the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Utilized for efficient state management, allowing seamless
  data flow and synchronization in the app.
- **CSS:** We've meticulously crafted the styling and design with CSS to provide
  an appealing and intuitive interface.
- **Material-UI:** Used to enhance the website's user interface and design.
- **Database:** To store user data, photos, and related information.
- **Authentication:** Incorporating registration and login functionality for a
  secure user experience.

These technologies work together harmoniously to deliver a feature-rich,
user-friendly application and website experience.
